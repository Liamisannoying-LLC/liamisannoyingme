The water me, me the water, my being supported by what is now part of my existence.  I can taste the freeness, free of air. I need not understand, only know. I can see it, the water my new medium for movement.  I can feel the others sinking alongside me, going down faster, for I imagine they don’t even think about the fall. I can even hear the experience, the flow, the bubbles. Sound moves faster underwater, k’now. Can I smell anything? That would be something I would be able to sacrifice.  But I’m not, not able. I continue being true, to myself, those souls that sunk and continue to live, and most of all, I am true to the truth. For the truth? It has some variations you should meet."
