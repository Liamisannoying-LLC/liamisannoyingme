Thomas Hobbes for children

Unlikely, but who knows

In a world not so distant, humans graced the stage of existence with their peculiarities. Among their endearing qualities (some more convenient than others), a truth emerged: the human condition yearned for the embrace of power structures.

Imagine a realm devoid of power structures. Chaos would reign supreme! Picture humans navigating the vast expanse of decision-making without the guiding hand of authority. Envision them congregating in town squares, passionately debating the merits of various ice cream flavors. Arguments would ensue, with staunch advocates for chocolate, fervent defenders of vanilla, and a whimsical faction championing the audacious fusion of anchovy and caramel.

In this absence of power structures, chaos would seize the ice cream enthusiasts. Scoops of disagreement would soar through the air, landing with comical thuds. Eventually, the pandemonium would reach such absurd heights that only a superhero of epic proportions, perhaps Captain Gelato, could restore order to this frozen realm.

Ah, the peculiarities of human nature! Humans possess a captivating blend of ambition and vulnerability. They aspire to greatness while wrestling with insecurities. Hence, power structures become comforting blankets for their fragile psyches, enabling them to navigate the treacherous terrain of existence, soothing fears and affirming self-worth.

The theater of power unfurls its grand spectacle, with leaders adorning metaphorical capes and crowns, projecting an aura of wisdom and authority. The masses, in awe of their perceived sagacity, conveniently overlook that even leaders misplace their reading glasses or occasionally forget their own birthdays.

Yet, let us not be too harsh on our fellow humans, for power structures also serve as catalysts for collective action. They harness the collective will of the masses toward shared goals. From the construction of towering civilizations to the launch of rockets into the boundless sky, power structures provide the framework for human achievements, enabling them to reach lofty aspirations.

However, amid the grandeur and chaos, a whisper of wisdom echoes. Humans must recognize the fallibility of power structures. They can be manipulated, abused, and distorted. Leaders may succumb to their egos or lose sight of the greater good. When such occurrences transpire, it becomes the collective responsibility of humanity to recalibrate and realign their power structures, ensuring justice, equality, and compassion prevail—perhaps even making room for the most eccentric of ice cream flavors.

So, as we behold the peculiar dance of the human condition, with its unrelenting pursuit of power (and its propensity for misplacing keys), let us cherish the profound insights it offers. Through this whimsical spectacle, this interplay of power, humans discover not only their limitations but also their boundless potential to fashion a world adorned with fairness and empathy—a world where the most extraordinary of flavors find their rightful place -- even if it involves the unlikely fusion of anchovy and caramel.
