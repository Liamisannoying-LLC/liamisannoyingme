    <!-- Instructions for running the game -->
    <p>Because of the way that the JavaScript files are structured (there are multiple for different aspects of the game such as bullets, enemies, and the player), this project will not work if you simply try to open the file in a browser (a safety feature most browsers have). Instead, you can run it locally, as a webserver.</p>
    <p>To do this, open the project in an editor that has a terminal, open the terminal, and run 'Python3 -m http.server 8080' (if 8080 happens to be in use, you can choose anything else, such as 4040 or 1000). You should then be able to go to <a href="http://localhost:8080">http://localhost:8080</a> (or whatever port you picked), and see the project there.</p>
    <p>Note 1: when you go to the page first, some browsers may try to change the start of the URL from 'http' to 'https', you can fix this by going to the URL and fixing it. Note 2: if you have visited a particular port before, your browser may have an old version of the page cached. For help with this (on google), you can see <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/32050?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop">here</a>.</p>
