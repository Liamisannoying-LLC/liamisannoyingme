_Proper readme needs to be written._

This is the source code of the useless and boring site www.liamisannoying.me.

Right now, liamisannoying is very broken. We have had to deconstruct and pretty much delete all of it in order for it to be put back together in a better form ASAP (as slow as possible). So yes, currently it isn't anything to look at.

For more information on Potsu (the game engine) and more, please check out the Wiki [here](https://github.com/The-Liamisannoying-Foundation/liamisannoyingme/wiki).
