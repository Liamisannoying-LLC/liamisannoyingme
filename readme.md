_Proper readme needs to be written._

This is the source code of the useless and boring site www.liamisannoying.me.

For more information on Potsu (the game engine) and more, please check out the Wiki [here](https://github.com/The-Liamisannoying-Foundation/liamisannoyingme/wiki).

Beware: # __**spagetti code lies within**__.

Yes, that is why we can't be bothered to explain it, it's funny to see you people try to understand.

Good luck.
